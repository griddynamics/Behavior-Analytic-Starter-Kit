Recipe has been changed by Sasha Polonsky. In original recipe the default web site did not process
any PHP scripts and could only serve static content. After my changes nginx expects to find php-fpm
process listening on localhost:9000 (see the file templates/default/default_site.erb)

I have also added to default_site.erb some configuration specific for running Wordpress, based on
my work experience.
