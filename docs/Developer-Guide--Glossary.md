- **Behavior Analytics platform** - is a Hadoop cluster with map/reduce jobs that can be run in the cluster. 
    There are two map/reduce jobs: transaction log generator and recommendation processor.
- **Transaction** - is the set of ID of unique products from product catalog, 
    which  was purchased together by single user at once.
- **Transaction log** - is text file that contains the set of transactions.
- **Recommendation processor** - is the map/reduce job, that implements improved version of PFP-growth algorithm and 
    extracts associative rules out of transaction log and present them as recommendations.
- **Associative rules** - are if-then statements based on attribute value conditions 
    that occur frequently together in a given transaction log.
- **PFP algorithm** - is acronym of Parallel Frequent Patterns Growth algorithm, 
    see more information [here](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~echang/recsys08-69.pdf)
- **Recommendations** - is the set of association rules in form of hash-map, 
    where the key is set of ID of selected item(s) and 
    the value is set of IDs of items usually purchased together with selected item(s).
- **Recommendation engine** - is the part of Web Store web UI that operates with recommendations, 
    generated by recommendation processor, and refresh recommendations view after each change of shopping cart.
- [**Hadoop.**](http://hadoop.apache.org) In our starter kit we are using two services from Hadoop ecosystem: 
    HDFS and MapReduce in minimal cluster configuration (one master node with namenode and jobtracker services and 
    many slaves with datanode and tasktracker service).
- [**Mahout**](http://mahout.apache.org) - is a scalable machine learning library. 
    Core algorithms are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm.
    In our starter we are using PFP Growth implementation.
- [**Ganglia**](http://ganglia.sourceforge.net) - is a scalable distributed system monitor tool. 
    Hadoop services are send metrics to Ganglia and Ganglia show it in pretty graphs.
- [**Broadleaf**](http://www.broadleafcommerce.org) - is open source e-commerce framework. 
    Weâ€™ve get demo site and add some features: 
    import/export product catalog, import recommendation and show recommendation in basket.
- [**Chef**](http://www.opscode.com/chef) - is configuration management system. 
    We are using chef in solo mode to customize virtual machines.
- [**Qubell.**](http://qubell.com) The Qubell Adaptive Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is a multi-tenant service 
    that provides the enterprise clients with an open,
    extendable and highly customizable application management automation platform for development, 
    testing, deployment and operational support of complex multi-tier applications on heterogeneous cloud and 
    non-cloud infrastructures.  It manage high level logic of deployment and maintenance processes 
    for application in cluster/cloud environment.
