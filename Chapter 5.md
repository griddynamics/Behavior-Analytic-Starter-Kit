Chapter 5: Summary and What’s Next?
===================================
Summary of what you’ve learned
------------------------------
Let’s summarize the main concepts of this starter kit:

- Product recommendations is one of the most commonly used applications of behavior analytics algorithms
- Product recommendations can be added to any existing web store using an approach similar to the one we used in this starter kit
- Recommendations are computed via a distributed Hadoop job by looking at the history of what people have purchased and finding products that are often bought together 
- If you don’t have a real transaction log before you get started on the development of your recommendation algorithm, you may want to generate a synthetic log using a generator similar to one provided with the kit
- Qubell makes is easy to package all components of a distributed system, including monitoring tools like Ganglia - to enable one-button provisioning of these systems on demand
- Starter Kit allows anyone to get started with writing their own product recommendation engines, or other types of analytics applications. All of its components are available under open source licenses

What’s Next?
------------
We hope that this starter kit will serve as a jump-start for your own behavior analytics projects. Here are some ideas on what you might want to do as an extension to the kit’s built-in functionality:
- Integrate our recommendation engine with your own, real-world web store
- Improve on our algorithm by providing an alternative, more sophisticated analytics
- Build a proper release engineering process for your analytics project by defining different development, testing and production environments using Qubell Apaptive PaaS technology
- You may want specifically to change the deployment infrastructure from Amazon cloud to any other public cloud, a private cloud or an internal non-cloud environment. 
- Note: for use of Qubell on non-public clouds you’ll need to upgrade your free account to a paid enterprise account. Contact [info@qubell.com](mailto:info@qubell.com) for more information
- Develop other analytics applications using our Hadoop development, deployment and management infrastructure. 
- Contact Grid Dynamics at [starterkit@griddynamics.com](mailto:starterkit@griddynamics.com) with any other ideas and we’ll be happy to help point you in the right direction to the best of our abilities
