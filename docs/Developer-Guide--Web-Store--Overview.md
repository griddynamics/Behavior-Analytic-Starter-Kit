Web Store Overview
==================

Web Store is simple shopping cart application based on [demo web application](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite)
of [Broadleaf Commerce framework](http://www.broadleafcommerce.org).
In this Web Store we have added a simple recommendation engine that shows recommendations to cart content. 
Recommendations can be uploaded to Web Store via REST API.
Also you can upload custom product catalog using REST API.
