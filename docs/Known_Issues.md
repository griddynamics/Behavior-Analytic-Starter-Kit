Known Issues
------------
1. Web Store, Sample Store and ecask-site are different names of the same thing - [Web Store](Developer-Guide--Web-Store--Overview.md)
2. We have two "Display name" fields on add application form: first one for Behavior Analytic Platform, second for Web Store
3. HTML isn't working on add application form, so [licence](/LICENCE) link displays incorrect.  
4. Cookbook tarball now placing in our Amazon S3 bucket. It will switch to github tarball in next release.
