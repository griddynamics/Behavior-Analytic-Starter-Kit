1. Short description of catalog
-------------------------------
Catalog of common user error messages is to help resolve errors by end-user of Behavior Analytic Starter Kit. We will try to log some possible errors which were happened at particular time and with particular conditions. It can be related with changes in global environment: permanent or temporary. We will try to log some possible errors which were happened at particular time and with particular version of Starter Kit and Qubell.
Starter kit level errors, these are errors with our functionality workflows (buttons): input parameters can be wrong, sequence of steps in scenario can be unsupported  because some workflows are using output from others. Platform or Global environment level errors: errors with state of global environment. It can be: Amazon EC2 or S3 fail, Qubell fail, Cloudera repository fail, public internet access from VM in amazon is failed, github fail.
