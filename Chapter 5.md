==========================================

![Steps workflow diagram](/Images/steps2.png)

This is a brief overview of the steps needed to see the recommendation products in action. You have already completed half of the steps. Now let's get started on the remaining steps.  

1) Put product catalog structure to S3
-------------------------------------
Once you have successfully loaded the product catalog from S3 to Web Store, press the "Save_product_catalog_structure_to_S3" button in Web Store to put product catalog structure from Web Store to your Amazon S3 bucket. Keep the default settings or you may change the S3 product catalog structure filename as you wish. Now product catalog structure will be uploaded to your private bucket on Amazon S3.

2) Generate sample transaction log
-------------------------------
To generate a sample transaction log, you must first go to the Recommendation Engine application and click on the "Load_transaction_log_from_S3" button to load the transaction log.

After the application has finished successfully launching that job, next click on the "Generate_new_transaction_log" to generate a sample transaction log. As a result, a transaction log generator job (LINK describing transaction log generator job) will be launched. Keep the default settings or you may change them (URLs to transaction log generator job and configuration file, and your Amazon S3 bucket and filename), as you wish.

4) Load Recommendations from S3
---------------------------
The final step to receiving the recommendations is to load the recommendations from S3 to the Web Store. To do so, go back to the Web Store applications and click the "Load_recommendations_from_S3" button. Keep the default settings, or if you have changed the filename previously, make sure it stays consistent. Congratulations, you can now see your starter kit in action!
